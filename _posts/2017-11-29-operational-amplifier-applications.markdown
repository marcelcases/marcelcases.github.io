## Introduction and goal
The operational amplifier (op amp) is a very versatile analog component that, depending on 
its configuration, allows to do some operations like amplify, add, subtract, integrate, oscillate 
or filter analog signals. They are some of the typical applications where the component 
is used in daily electronics.
The goal of the document is to study from an introductory point of view some of the 
applications mentioned above. To this end, a series of typical circuits built from 
this component will be simulated and their behavior will be analyzed. Finally, 
there are a number of frequently asked questions related to the op amp.
The circuits are based on the information and examples found at [ref. 2] and [ref. 3]. 
The basic operation of the circuits is found at [ref. 4].
By default, if the opposite is not indicated, the following features are common for all of the circuits:
* Virtual OPAMP for simulation, Â±12V supply
* From 10k to 100k resistors
* Frequency of 1kHz
